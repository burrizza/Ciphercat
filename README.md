# Ciphercat

The Firefox Add-on Ciphercat is based on [Local-PGP](https://github.com/x0th/Local-PGP) from [x0th](https://github.com/x0th) and has been developed to enable easy cryptography for everyone and everywhere.
Like in Local-PGP, the [OpenPGP.js](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs) library has been used for all the cryptographic  stuff.

Please consider this as a fun add-on and don't rely on its functionality! I tried to make it stable and secure, but it was a short time project only and bugs are surely included!

Thanks to all developers and please let me know if I made something wrong or you are unhappy with this development!

## Features (in development)

* Generate, add and manage locally stored OpenPGP keys.
* Use a Masterkey (which is kept in memory only) to encrypt and decrypt all locally stored data.
* Use your clipboard for easy and quick cryptography.
* Use an automatic encryption and decryption feature for:
	- wordpress (ever wanted make a blog that no one can read, **this is your chance!**)
	- twitter **(in active development)** (This enables a private user group feature. **Eat this, bird!**)
	- **more coming**


**Please note: This addon is not yet meant to get out of alpha stage. By usage, there is always a very high chance to loose all your keys and with that, also all your encrypted data. Feel free to use the addon as a funny gimmick, but please don't hardly rely on its security and functionality!**

## Platforms

Currently this add-on only exist for Firefox but it should be easy to port it to Chrome and this could happen in near future. Plans to integrate the service in some Android app also exist.
